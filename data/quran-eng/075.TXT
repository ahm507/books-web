SURAH 75
AL-QIYAMAH
The Resurrection
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.	
    This surah speaks about the Resurrection, requital, and the horrible events of the Day of Judgment. It assures the Prophet that the Qur’an will be stored in his heart. It warns those who prefer this life below to the Hereafter and contrasts the blooming countenances of the believers to the scowling faces of the disbelievers. The surah also speaks about the status of man the moment he encounters death, when he recalls having hidden his negligence of Allah’s orders as if he would never be requited. It ends with showing evidence that enjoins belief in Resurrection.

    1. No! I swear by the Day of Resurrection, 
    2. No, and I swear by the self-blaming self.
    3. Does man reckon that We will never gather his bones?
    4. No indeed, We will determine how to mold over (again) his finger-tip.
    5. Indeed, man wants to act impiously (for the rest of his life).
    6. And he asks when that Day of Resurrection is.
    7. Then when the sight is dazed,
    8. And the moon is eclipsed.
    9. And the sun and the moon are gathered together,
    10. On that Day man will say, “Where is the flight?”
    11. But never! There is no subterfuge! 
    12. That Day to your Lord will be the repository!
    13. There and then man will be informed of all the good he forwarded and all he deferred.
    14. Each one will be his own demonstration.
    15. Even if he cast forth his excuses.
    16. Do not move your tongue with (the Qur’an) to hasten on with it.
    17. Surely, it is upon Us the gathering of it and (your) ability to read it.
    18. When We have read it to you, then follow its reading.
    19. Then it is for Us its evident (exposition).
    20. But you (mankind) love the hasty (world).
    21. And you leave behind the Hereafter.
    22. There and then some faces will have blooming countenances.
    23. Looking at their Lord.
    24. Other faces will be scowling,
    25. Expecting the calamity that will be done to them.
    26. When the self reaches the clavicles,
    27. And it is said, “Who is the healing (encounter)?”
    28. And the person expects the parting.
    29. And the shank is entwined with shank. 
    30. To your Lord upon that Day will be the driving (procession). 
    31. So (the disbeliever) neither believed the Messenger nor did he pray.
    32. But he cried lies and turned away.
    33. Then he went to his family striding haughtily. 
    34. So now, woe for you, man, then, woe for you!
    35. Thereafter woe for you, then woe for you!
    36. Does man think that he will be left in vain?
    37. Was he not a sperm-drop ejaculated?
    38. Thereafter he was a clot. So He created, then He molded.
    39. And He made of him two spouses,
    40. Is He not the Determiner to give life to the dead?
