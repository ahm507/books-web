SURAH 106
QURAYSH
The Quraysh Tribe
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    In this surah, Allah addresses the nobility of the Quraysh tribe to remind them of how He destroyed their enemy and saved the Ka`bah, which they were custodians of. It reminds them of how He united them and how He gave them security locally as well as in their trade expeditions to Yemen in winter and to Syria in summer. No one posed danger to them, while other people around them suffered insecurity.
  
    1. The accord among the people of Quraysh into one whole body, 
    2. And the customary accord for their winter and summer caravans,
    3. So, let them worship the Lord of this House.
    4. He fed them after hunger and gave them the security after fear.
