SURAH 111
AL-MASAD
The Infernal Rope
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    This surah opens with a statement asserting the annihilation of Abu Lahab, the enemy of Allah and His Messenger, and that nothing can save him from this end, be it money or social status or anything else. It threatens him that he will suffer in the blazing Fire that emits mountainous flames together with his wife, who was set to a special kind of punishment: She will be necklaced with a twisted rope of palm fibers to double her torment and augment her pain in requital of hurting the Prophet and slandering his call.
 
    1. Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab!
    2. Neither his wealth nor all he earned will avail him (from the punishment that awaits him).
    3. He will roast at a flaming Fire,
    4. Along with his wife (the slanderer), the constant bearer of firewood.
    5. She will be necklaced with a twisted infernal (of palm fibers).
