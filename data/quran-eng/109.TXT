SURAH 109
AL-KAFIRUN
The Pagans or The Disbelievers
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    In this surah, Allah commands His Messenger to proclaim to the disbelievers that he in no way may bargain with them concerning his call to Allah. He will adhere to worshiping Allah, than Whom there is no god; whereas they are adhering to worshiping their idols, which will never help them. They have their religion that they inherited from their fathers, and he has his religion that Allah chose for him.
   
    1. Say, Muhammad, “O you disbelievers,
    2. “I do not worship what you worship (besides Allah);
    3. “Nor are you worshiping (Allah) Whom I worship;
    4. “Nor am I worshiping what you have worshiped.
    5. “Nor are you worshiping what I worship.
    6. “To you is your religion, and to me is my religion (which Allah has chosen for me).”
