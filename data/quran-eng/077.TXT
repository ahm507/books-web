SURAH 77
AL-MURSALAT
The Errands
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    This surah speaks about the resurrection, states evidence to prove it, and threatens those who deny it more than ten times throughout the surah, portraying the humiliation and torment the disbelievers will suffer. On the other hand, it gives glad tidings to the pious, portraying the blessings and welfare they will enjoy in Paradise. It ends by stressing that a horrible end will be waiting for the disbelievers who deny the Qur’an.
