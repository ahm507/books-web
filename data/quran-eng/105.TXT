SURAH 105
AL-FIL
The Elephant
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    In this surah, Allah informs His Messenger of the story of the Companions of the Elephant, who decided to demolish Allah’s House, the Ka`bah. It draws his attention to the signs of Allah’s omnipotence portrayed in the story, as He inflicted His punishment on transgressors in return for violating His sacred places. Allah sent His armies, which annihilated them so that you cannot find a trace of them.
    1. Have you seen, Muhammad, how Allah your Lord performed with the companions of the elephant?
    2. And you know that He made their plotting into great error.
    3. He sent upon them throngs of baleful birds,
    4. Throwing at them stones of baked clay,
    5. Until they became like the blades eaten up.
