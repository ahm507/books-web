SURAH 100
AL-`ADIYAT
The High-Mettle Steeds
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    At the beginning of this surah, Allah swears by the high-mettle steeds and their role in fighting the enemy, that mankind is indeed ungrateful. Mankind bears witness to this discord, and he is so greedy for wealth. In the end, the surah reminds people of the resurrection and requital.
 
    1. By the snorting steeds,
    2. And the strikers (of fire) in sparks,
    3. And by the morning raiders,
    4. Raising clouds of dust (at the enemy barracks),
    5. To penetrate into the midst of a gathering.
    6. Man is indeed ungrateful to Allah his Lord.
    7. And he bears constant witness hereafter to that.
    8. And he is constantly in love for wealth.
    9. Does he not know what happens when what is in graves is scattered out,
    10. And whatever is in the breasts is sought out.
    11. Surely, upon that Day, their Lord is indeed Ever-Cognizant of them.
