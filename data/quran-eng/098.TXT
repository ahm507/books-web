SURAH 98
AL-BAYYINAH
The Evidence
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    The People of the Book knew from their Scriptures, and the idolaters of Makkah knew from them, the attributes of the Last Prophet, which should have inspired them to believe in him once he was sent to them. But when the Messenger was sent to them supported by the Qur’an, they disagreed among themselves and broke their promise. The responsibility of the People of the Book in this regard is more binding than that of the idolaters. On the other hand, the believers who attained the highest of the high in virtue and piety are the best created beings. Their reward is to dwell forever in Paradise and feel satisfied with the pleasures and grace that they obtained. This honorable end is stored for the one who reveres Allah as He deserves.
 
    1. Neither the disbelievers among the People of the Book nor the associators were going to change (their position) until the supreme had come to them
    2. Through a Messenger from Allah to recite to them Scriptures of purity.
    3. In them are ever-upright Books.
    4. But those who were given the Book among the Christians and Jews only became disunited after they had received this clear divine evidence (that Muhammad is the Messenger referred to in their Scriptures).
    5. Yet they have been commanded to worship no one but Allah, making religion faithfully His, and to keep up prayer, and give the poor-due and that is the religion most upright. 
    6. The disbelievers among the People of the Book and the associators will be in the Fire of Hell, eternally therein. They are the most evil beings.
    7. But those who believed in Allah and did righteous deeds are the most charitable beings.
    8. Their recompense with their Lord is Gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers run, eternally abiding therein. Allah is satisfied with them; and they are satisfied with Him. That is for him who is apprehensive of his Lord.
