SURAH 93
AD-DUHA
The Forenoon
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    This surah opens with two solemn declarations expressive of the time of activity and that of quietude: that Allah Has not abandoned His Messenger or disfavored him, and that He prepares for him high ranks in the Hereafter that excel what he experiences here. Then Allah gives a solemn declaration that He will generously bestow on him what will meet with his expectation of blessing and benefaction. What preceded attests to what will follow: the Messenger was an orphan and Allah took him into His care; he was wandering and Allah guided him; he was poor and Allah gave him riches. Then the verses call him not to mistreat or humiliate the orphan, nor to be unkind to one who addresses a petition to him, and to express his gratitude by announcing Allah’s bounty upon him and all grace abounding in him.
 
    1. I swear by the forenoon,
    2. And by the night when it comes with its dark stillness.
    3. Allah your Lord has not disregarded you, nor does He disfavor you.
    4. Indeed, the Hereafter will be more charitable for you than the first life.
    5. And Allah your Lord will give you so that you will be satisfied.
    6. Did He not find you an orphan, and He gave you abode?
    7. Did He not find you erring and He guided you?
    8. And did He not find you needy, and He made you rich?
    9. Therefore, do not subdue the orphan.
    10. And as for the beggar, do not scold him.
    11. And as for your Lord's favor, discourse about it!
