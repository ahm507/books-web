SURAH 95
AT-TIN
The Fig
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    Allah swears by two blessed fruits and two blessed places, that He created man in the best shape and equipped him with a will and many other perfect qualities. Then the surah mentions that man has not fulfilled his duties and, therefore, he was degraded to the lowest level, except for those who believed in Allah and imprinted their deeds with piety. Allah has provided only those with His grace. Then the surah reproaches those who denied resurrection after Allah’s signs of omnipotence and wisdom were clearly shown to them.
 
    1. I swear by the fig and the olive;
    2. And by Mount Sinai (where Allah declared in words His supreme majesty to Musa [Moses]);
    3. And by this secure and trustworthy land,
    4. That We created man in the fairest stature. 
    5. Then We turned him back to the basest of the base.
    6. But not those who believed and did righteous deeds; these will have a reward unfailing.
    7. And so, who cries lies to you about the religion?
    8. Is Allah not the Most Judicious of Judges!
