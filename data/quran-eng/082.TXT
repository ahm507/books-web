SURAH 82
AL-INFITAR
The Cleaving
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    This surah portrays some horrendous events of Doomsday in a way that implies that they will come to pass soon, on a day when every person will know all it has sent before and what it has left behind. The surah then warns mankind of being careless toward the Creator Who brought him into being, fashioned and proportioned him, and cast him in the best form; yet man denies the Day of Judgment. It also asserts that there are guardian angels, noble and recording, above mankind. Then it mentions the blessings stored for the righteous believers and the Hell stored for the wicked who will burn in there on the Day of Judgment—a Day on which no person has power at all to do anything for any other person. The absolute Command on that day is Allah’s.

    1. When once the heaven is rent asunder,
    2. And the planets are strewn,   
    3. And the seas are made to gush forth,
    4. And the graves are scattered away,
    5. There and then every self will know whatever it has forwarded and deferred.
    6. O man! What has deluded concerning your Ever-Honorable Lord?
    7. Who created you (from nothingness) and molded you, then proportioned you!	 
    8. He shapes you in whatever fashion He wills.
    9. No, but you cry lies to the Day of Doom.
    10. Yet, in fact, you are watched by preserver angel.
    11. Honorable writers.
    12. They know whatever you perform.
    13. Surely the benign will be in (the heavenly) bliss.
    14. The impious will be indeed in Hellfire,
    15. Roasting therein on the Day of Doom.
    16. In no way will they be absent therefrom.
    17. What makes you realize what the Day of doom is?
    18.  Again, what makes you realize what the Day of doom is?
    
    19. It is the Day when no self can possess anything (to help) another self, and the full Command there and then is to Allah.
