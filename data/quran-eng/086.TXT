SURAH 86
AT-TARIQ
The Bright Star
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    This surah opens with a solemn declaration exemplifying Allah’s omnipotence by asserting that every self is protected by a guardian angel who watches over innocence and folly. The surah calls upon man to ponder on his origination and reminds him that he was created from an emitted fluid, in order that he may conclude that He Who created him from nothingness can bring him to life again after death. Then the surah gives another solemn declaration asserting that the Qur’an is an authoritative revelation and canon of faith that is conclusive, determinate, and decisive. It is not the object of ridicule, nor is it derisive. Yet the disbelievers, in their effort to misguide people and divert them from Allah’s Path, keep plotting and scheming, but Allah plans an unfailing scheme. The surah ends with a plea to Muhammad to overlook their actions and give them respite.
 
    1. By the heaven and the bright star.
    2. And you just do not realize what the bright star is like!
    3. It is the rapping, piercing star. 
    4. There is no self but has a preserver over him (writing his good or bad deeds).
    5. Let man look from what was he created!
    6. He was created from effusive water.
    7. The fluid issues forth from the backbone and the ribs.
    8. Indeed Allah is Determiner over his return (to life).
    9. On the Day when secret thoughts and deeds are tried.
    10. This is the Day when no one will have power or vindicator.
    11. I swear by the heaven comprising (the condensed water vapor) it returns.
    12. And by the earth with crevices (to allow plants to grow),
    13. The Qur’an is a decisive Saying.
    14. And it is not mere joking.
    15. The disbelievers keep plotting (evil plots).
    16. And I, Allah, plots (unfailing) plots.
    17. And so, Muhammad, give them leisure a while.
