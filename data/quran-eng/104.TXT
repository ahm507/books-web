SURAH 104
AL-HUMAZAH
The Slanderer
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    In this surah, Allah warns against traducing and amassing wealth, which will not confer eternity or avert punishment in the abyss of Hell. Those who do so will be gathered in Hell, which finds its way to the innermost being of bodies and hearts, and from it they will find no escape.
    
    1. Woe to every slanderer and defamer, 
    2. Who amasses money and multiplies it (for the sake of accumulating wealth).
    3. He reckons that his fortune will make him eternal.
    4. Never! But he (and all that he amassed) will be flung into the hutamah, a crushing Fire. 
    5. You just do not realize what the hutamah  (the crushing Fire) is!
    6.  It is the Fire of Allah kindled,
    7. Which views the heart-sights. 
    8. It is vaulted (over the wicked),
    9. In pillars widely extended.
