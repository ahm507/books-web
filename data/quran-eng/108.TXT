SURAH 108
AL-KAWTHAR
Fountain of Grace
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    In this surah, Allah reminds His Messenger that He gave him joyful tidings of the grace He has bestowed on him. It commands him to keep praying to Allah alone and then to execute the sacrifice as a sign of gratitude for the grace Allah has conferred upon him. It ends with giving glad tidings to the Prophet that his enemy will be cut off from all hope and posterity, and will drown in shame.
  
    1. We have given you, Muhammad, the abundance (of good things). 
    2.  (In return,) perform your prayer first, and then slaughter the sacrifice.
    3. Your antagonist is without offspring.
