SURAH 87
AL-A`LA
The Most Exalted
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    The surah opens with inducing people to glorify Allah, Who perfected everything He created, guided every being to its befitting course, and brought forth the vegetation and made it decay. Then the verses assert that Allah will make His Prophet recite the Qur’an and memorize it, except as Allah will abrogate, and that He will facilitate his task. Then Allah commands His Prophet to exhort the people with the Qur’an so that whoever is willing to revere Allah may remember it; whereas the wicked will avoid it; they are destined to suffer in Hell the immense fire. It also asserts that prosperity and blessings will be for him who repents his sins and is benevolent, who remembers Allah and performs the prescribed prayers. The surah ends up with pointing out that its content was foretold in the earlier Scriptures of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses).

    1. Glorify the Name of Allah your Lord, The Most Exalted,
    2. Who created and so He molded.
    3. Who determined; and so He guided, 
    4. Who also brings forth the pasturage,
    5. Then He makes it dark stubble.
    6. We will make you read so that you will not forget,
    7. Except as Allah decides. He knows loud speech, and what is concealed. 
    8. We will ease for you the Easiest Way.
    9. And so, remind in case the Reminder profits.
    10. The apprehensive will constantly remember.
    11. And the most wretched will avoid it.
    12. Who will roast in the Greatest Fire.
    13. In which he does not die nor live.
    14. But prosperous, indeed, is he who cleanses himself,
    15. Who remembers the Name of his Lord; so he prays.
    16. But you people prefer the present life,
    17. While the Hereafter is more charitable, and more enduring. 
    18. All that is (mentioned) in the earlier Scrolls,
    19. The Scrolls of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses).
