Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    In this surah, Allah commands His Prophet to take refuge in Him and seek His help to deter a great evil that most people are unaware of, as it penetrates them through their desires and whims and thus leads them to error.

    2. “The King of mankind,
    3. “The God over mankind,
    4. “From the evil of the slinking whisperer,
    5. “Who whispers in the breasts of mankind,
    6. “Of the jinn and mankind.”
