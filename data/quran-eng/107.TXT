SURAH 107
AL-MA`UN
Support of the Poor
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    This surah defines the attributes of the one who denies the requital hereafter: He mistreats the orphan and never commends feeding the indigent, due to meanness. Then it speaks about people who are similar to him, that is, those who are negligent of their act of worship, and when they perform it, their countenances reflect absent-mindedness, and they deny aid to the indigent. The surah threatens them with a heinous end so that they may stop transgression. 
  
    1. Have you seen him who cries lies to the Doom?
    2. Such is he who repulses the orphan,
    3. And does not urge the feeding of the indigent.
    4. And so, woe to those who pray,
    5. Who are unmindful of their prayers,
    6. Those who show off,
    7. And (refuse and) prevent small kindnesses.
