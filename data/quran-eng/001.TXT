AL-FATIHAH
The Opening
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
     As the opening of the Qur’ân, this sûrah (chapter) 
is considered the “Mother of the Book.” The opening 
sûrah emphasizes the oneness, uniqueness, omnipotence, 
and ultimate authority of Allâh the Creator.
     It is a prayer that imparts to the Muslims 
systematic instruction in preparation for education and 
character formation, and comfort in distress; and it 
inculcates deep faith. The sûrah’s words flow from Allâh 
to the hearts in the form of an invocation.
     1. In the Name of Allâh, The All-Merciful, The Ever-
Merciful.
     2. Praise be to Allâh, the Lord of the worlds,
     3. The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful,
     4. The Absolute Sovereign Who alone has the 
authority over the Day of Judgment. 
     5. It is You and You alone Whom we worship, it is 
You and You alone Whom we invoke and implore for aid.
     6. Guide us, O Allâh, to the Straight Path,
     7. The path of those whom You have favored, not (the 
path of) those against whom You are angered,nor the erring.
