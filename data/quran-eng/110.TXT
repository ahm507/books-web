SURAH 110
AN-NASR
The Victory
Revealed at Madinah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    This surah commands the Prophet—when Allah’s help and victory come, the gates of Makkah are declared open to him, and he sees the people embracing Allah’s system of faith and worship in great numbers —to praise Allah and extol His glorious attributes and to invoke His forgiveness for himself and for the believers. For, indeed, Allah accepts repentance and forgives inequities. 
 
    1. When Allah’s victory comes and the Conquest (of Makkah),
    2. And you see mankind entering Allah’s religion in troops,
    3. Then extol your Lord with praise, and ask His forgiveness.
