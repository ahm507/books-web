SURAH 94
ASH-SHARH
Solace
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    This surah asserts that Allah has expanded His Prophet’s breast and equipped him with wisdom and knowledge, eased him of the burden of calling to Allah, and combined his name with Allah’s name in the rites of the religion. Then the verses mention Allah’s favors—that ease goes with hardships. It calls upon the Prophet to hasten to a new good deed once he has finished doing one, to keep remembering Allah, and to make Him his purpose, as He alone can help him.
 
    1. Have We not expanded your breast?
    2. And We unloaded your burden of the heavy encumbrance, 
    3. Which weighed down your back,
    4. And We raised for your famous name?
    5. Surely with difficulty comes ease.
    6. Yes, indeed, with difficulty comes ease.
    7.  Therefore, when you are at leisure (from worldly duties), exert yourself (in prayer),
    8. And make Allah your Lord your desirous goal.
