SURAH 99
AZ-ZALZALAH
The Earth in Convulsions
Revealed at Madinah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    The verses of this surah are restricted to talking about some phases of Doomsday: When the earth quakes and casts its treasures and the dead, and when man wonders and exclaims, “What happened?” The people will go forth in groups of like attributes to be requited in proportion to their deeds.
 
    1. When the earth is quaked with its (final) earthquake,
    2. And when it brings out its burdensome contents,
    3. And man says, “What is the matter with it?”
    4.Upon that day, the earth will discourse about its tidings,
    5. That your Lord has given it revelation.
    6. Upon that day, mankind will go forward in diverse groups to be shown their deeds. 
    7. Then he who has done an atom’s weight of good will see it (and profit by it).
    8. And he who has done an atom’s weight of evil will see it (and be punished for it. And Allah wrongs no one).
