SURAH 113
AL-FALAQ
The Daybreak
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    This surah commands the Prophet to resort to Allah and take refuge in Him from all harmful creatures, from the night of intense darkness due to the distress that prevails within, from the sorceresses who seek to spoil the ties between people, and from the evil of the envier when he wishes Allah’s blessings and favors on people to disappear. 
  
    1. Say: “I take refuge in Allah, the Lord of the daybreak and the incipient gleam,
    2. “From the evil of what He has created,
    3. “And from the evil of the dusky night when it overspreads (its gloom),
    4. “And from the evil of the women who spit on the knots,
    5. “And from the evil of the envier when he envies (the advantages of others).”
