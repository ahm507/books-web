SURAH 97

The Highest Estimable Night
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    This surah glorifies the Qur’an and the night in which it was revealed, stressing that it is better than a thousand months, and that angels together with Jibril (Angel Gabriel) descend on that night by Allah’s permission with all decrees. It is a night of peace until the rising of the dawn.
 
    1. We have sent down the Qur’an in the Night of Determination.
    2. And what makes you realize what the Night of Determination is?
    3. The Night of Determination is more charitable than a thousand months.
    4. There, descend the angels and the Spirit (Jibril [Gabriel]) by the permission of their Lord with every Command.
    5.  Peace it is until the rising of the dawn.
