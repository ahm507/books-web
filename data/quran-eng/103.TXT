SURAH 103
AL-`ASR
The Era
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    Allâh swears by a distinctive period in the history of creation and by the signs exemplifying His omnipotence and wisdom, to indicate how man is at a loss, but not those who imprinted their deeds with wisdom and piety and who commended each other to adhere to the truth and to patience with what Allâh commanded them to do or not to do.
  
    1. I swear by the era distinctive of life (on earth),
    2. That man suffers loss (through negligence),
    3. Except those who believed in Allâh and did righteous deeds, and enjoin each other to the Truth, and enjoin each other to patience.
