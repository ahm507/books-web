SURAH 90
AL-BALAD
The Town
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    Allah swears by Makkah, the great sacred town where His Messenger was born and nurtured, and by the father and what he procreated, as exemplifying the existence of mankind, that man was created in strife and hardships. Yet, he is self-deceived and thinks that he is so powerful that he cannot be defeated and that he has plenty of money to spend on his whims and desires. Then Allah counts some of His favors that enable man to overcome his avarice on his way along the path of virtues to be among the people of Paradise—the companions of the right—and be as far as possible from the companions of the left, who will be gathered in Hell.

   1. I swear by this land.
   2. And you are an inhabitant of this land.
   3. And I swear by the begetter and what he begot.
   4. That We created man in suffering.
   5. Does he reckon no one can determine for him?
   6. He says, “I have consumed stacked wealth.” 
   7. Does he reckon no one sees him?
   8. Have We not made for him two eyes,
   9. And a tongue and two lips?
   10. And We guided him to the two ways?
   11. Yet, he has not rushed along the uneven track.
   12. And you just do not reckon what the uneven track is.
   13. It is the freeing of a slave, 
   14. Or feeding on a day of famine,
   15. Such as an orphan of (your) kin,
   16. Or an indigent in starvation,
   17. Besides being one of those who believed and enjoined one another to have patience and mercifulness.
18. Such persons are the companions of the rightfulness.
   19. But those who disbelieve in Our Signs are the companions of sinisterfulness.
   20. Over them is a Fire without any outlet.
