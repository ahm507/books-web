AN-NABA’
The News
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    This surah asserts that the Day of Resurrection is true, threatens those who doubt it, and assures that it will come to pass. It mentions some of its signs, then mentions the end of the disbelievers and of the pious. It ends with warning and cautioning the people of this horrible Day.

    1. What are they asking one another about?
    2. About the great news (of resurrection), 
    3. About which they differ among themselves.
    4. No, but they will come to know.
    5. Not at all, but they will come to know.
    6. Did We not prepare the earth to be a settled (habitation)?
    7. And the mountains as bulwarks. 
    8. We created you in pairs.
    9. We made your sleep repose (for relief),
    10. And We made the night a garment (that covers you by its darkness).
    11. And We made the daytime for livelihood.
    12. And We built above you seven strong heavens.
    13. And We installed a glowing luminary.
    14. And We sent down the clouds pressing forth cascading water.
    15. To bring forth with it grains and vegetation.
    16. And gardens entwined. 
    17. Indeed, the Day of the Verdict falls at a fixed time.
    18. This is the Day when the trumpet is blown and you come in troops.
    19. And the heaven is opened as gates.
    20. And the mountains made to travel in motion and become as a mirage.
    21. Hell was made a monitoring place.
    22. It is the resorting of the inordinates.
    23. There they linger for epochs.
    24. They will taste no coolness (for relief) or a drink.
    25. But only scalding water and their dusky (discharges).
    26. Recompense commensurate (with their evil deeds).
    27. They did not hope for a reckoning.
    28. And cried lies to Our signs, constantly lying. 
    29. But We enumerated everything in a book.
    30. Now taste (the outcome of your deeds), and We will never increase you in anything except torment.
    31. But for the pious, there is triumph (in the attainment of their goal):
    32. Orchards and vineyards,
    33. Youthful virgins, of like age,
    34. And a cup brimful (of delightful drink).
    35. No idle talk, nor lying will they hear in there.
    36. A recompense from Allah your Lord, and a gift as a reckoning.
    37. Lord of the heavens and the earth and all in between. The All-Merciful, Whom no one can address.
    38. This is the Day when the Spirit Jibril (Angel Gabriel) and the angels stand in ranks. They do not speak except he whom The All-Merciful permits, and then he says what is right.
    39. Indeed, this is the Day of Truth, and whoever decides may still turn to Allah his Lord for resorting.
    40. We have warned you of torment that is quite near. On the Day, everyone will look at what his hands have forwarded, and the disbeliever will say, “Would that I were dust!”
