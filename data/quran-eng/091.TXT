Surah 91
ASH-SHAMS
The Sun
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    At the beginning of this surah Allah swears by various phenomena attesting to His omnipotence and oneness, that the triumphant are those who purified themselves with faith and obedience, and the losers are those who indulged in disbelief and sins. Then He gives an example of the Thamud, the people of Salih, and the fate they encountered, with the aim that every person may ponder the lesson in it. When they denied their messenger and slaughtered the she-camel, Allah annihilated all of them without considering the consequences of their annihilation or the torture He inflicted on them, as He cannot be questioned as to what He does. He inflicted on them what they deserved.
  
    1. By the sun and its forenoon radiance.
    2. By the moon that follows it.
    3. By the day that manifests (the sun’s glory),
    4. By the night that envelops the sun (out of view),
    5. By the heaven and (Him) Who built it,
    6. And by the earth and Him Who spread it,
    7. And by the self and Him Who molded it,
    8. He inspired it with its impiety and piety.
    9. He has already prospered who has cleansed it.
    10. And he has already been disappointed who stunted it.
    11. The people of Thamud cried lies through their inordinance.
    12. When the most wretched of them deputed himself (to kill the she-camel)
13. Allah’s Messenger said to them, “That is the she-camel of Allah! Do not hinder her drinking.”
    14. But they cried lies to him. So they hamstrung it. Then their Lord devastated them for their guilty deed; so He leveled (the whole country). 
    15. For Allah fears not its ultimate consequences.
