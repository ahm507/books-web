SURAH 96
AL-`ALAQ
The Clinging Organism
Revealed at Makkah
In the Name of Allah,The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful.
    This surah presents a call to acquire knowledge through reading and learning, asserting that He Who created man from a weak origin is certainly able to teach him writing to acquire knowledge and to communicate with it, as well as teach him what he does not know. The surah also draws attention to the facts that wealth and power may lead man to transgression and that all beings will be assembled before Allah. It addresses whoever can be addressed, warning the tyrants who block the way of Allah and threatening them with being cast into Hellfire, where no intimate friend will be able to help them. It ends by calling those who submitted to Allah’s cause to oppose the obstinate deniers and to draw near to Allah by obeying Him.

    1. Read, Muhammad, in the Name of Allah your Lord, Who created,
    2. He created man from clots.
    3. Read! And realize that Allah your Lord is Most Honorable.
    4. He taught (man writing) by the pen.
    5. He taught man what he did not know.
    6. But no, man always goes inordinate,
    7. That he sees himself self-sufficient.
    8. But then to Allah your Lord will the return be.
    9. Have you seen the one who forbids
    10. A bondman when he prays?
    11. Have you seen that he is upon guidance,
    12. Or that he commands people to be pious?
    13. Do you see that he cries lies and turns away,
    14. Does he not know that Allah sees?
    15.  But no, if he does not refrain, We will trail him by the forelock,
    16. A lying, sinful forelock.
    17. And then let him call his assembly;
    18. We will call the guards of Hell.
    
    19. But no, do not obey him, and prostrate to Allah and draw near to Allah.*
